    <h2> "Such a life-changing expirience. Highly recommended!"</h2>
    <p> "Before joining the bootscamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands - on and i never had to wait long for assistance.The agile team projects in particular , was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in the way that no tutorial could ever have. "</p>
